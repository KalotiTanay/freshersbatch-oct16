<div>
	<p>Kishore Kumar was born in Bengali Brahmin Ganguly family in Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh, India.</p>
	<p>Kishore Kumar was an ardent admirer of Hollywood actor-singer Danny Kaye. In his later career, Kumar was heavily influenced by playback singer Ahmed Rushdi and his liking towards Rushdi was to the extent that former paid a tribute at Royal Albert Hall in London to the latter by singing some of his songs.</p>
	<p>Kumar employed yodeling in many of his songs including; Yeh dil na hota bechara, Zindagi ek safar hai suhana, and Chala jata hoon. The style eventually became an essential feature of his singing and was inspired by Jimmie Rodgers and Tex Morton.</p>
